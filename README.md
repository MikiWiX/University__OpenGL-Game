# Java OpenGL Game
### University task
###### Java, OpenGL, GLSL
#### Running
Import libraries from 'libs' and 'depencies-archieves', open 'Project' folder in your IDE of choice and run.
#### Description
A simple 3D game 'Space Invaders' made using Java and LWJGL libraries.
It is a game engine on its own.
#### Side Notes
This is probably my biggest personal project so far, and I also had a lot of fun making it.  
Now huge thanks to Yotu.be channel ThinMatrix for his tutorials on creating this.  
Most of my code here follows those tutorials.  
- parts of it are copied without much change, like Particle Package,
- parts are significantly modified, like entity rendering system,
- a lot of code has been created by me from scrath like:
  - entire modular level creation system using dedicated components
  - parallel loading screen, as well as parallel execution of physics and rendering on sesparate threads,
  - or of course all the models along with their movements

I have also learned GLSL and how Shaders work.

Textures used here are mostly free-to use or of my creation.

Here is a sample of how it looks like:
